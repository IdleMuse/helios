# Structures

**Structures** are buildings, complexes, and facilities, on the surfaces of planets and moons. Asteroids are too small to have permanent structures of this scale on them, and anything in orbit is instead classed as an [Orbital](/science/technology/orbital). Structures are built in a territory (of which there are normally between 5 and 10 per planet), and if your org loses control of the territory (or planet), they can no longer operate the structure. Moons have only one territory, but the same applies.

## Basic Structures

These are the basic structures that all orgs can build:

### Mine
When an org has taken control of a territory, it will ascertain if that territory has any valuable [materials](/economy/materials) in it. If it does, a mine can be built there. Mines require money to operate. A standard-sized mine costs **500cr/cycle** to operate. You cannot chose _not_ to operate a mine; it can pull you (or an org) into bankruptcy.

! See [Mining](/economy/mining) for more information on how much materials a mine produces.

A second mine in the same territory produces half as much resources as the first, for the same cost. A third would produce half as much as that, and so on.

Mines chosen as starting lunar enterprises can be chosen from the following list:
+ Helium-3
+ Thorium
+ Iron
+ Copper

! Mines cost **5,000cr**, **12.5kt of Iron**, **0.5kt of Copper**, **2.0kt of Diamonds**

### Reactor
A reactor produces electricity, needed to power other structures. All inhabited planets are assumed to have smaller power stations to provide energy for civilians; **Reactor** structures are only needed for power in the TW (Terrawatt) range.

There are two primary types of reactor:
+ A solar reactor produces between **1.0** and **2.0 TW** depending on distance from the sun and thickness of atmosphere.
+ A thorium reactor produces a maximum of **5.0 TW** of power but consumes Thorium fuel.

! A base Thorium reactor produces **1.0 + (KT of Thorium, squared) TW** if supplied at least **0.2 KT** of Thorium, up to a maximum of **5.0 TW** at **2.0 KT** of Thorium.

Helium-3 reactors are also possible to build (common in small sizes on ships) and produce a maximum of 2 TW of power by consuming (vast) quantities of He3.

! A Solar Reactor costs **4500cr**, **1.5kt of Iron**, **2.5kt of Copper**, **5.0kt of Silver**,
! A Thorium Reactor costs **22000cr**, **8.5kt of Iron**, **2.5kt of Copper**, **0.2kt of Vanadium**
! A Helium-3 Reactor costs **12000cr**, **1.5kt of Irom**, **2.5kt of Copper**, **5.0kt of Titanium**

### Factory
A factory comes in one of three types:
+ Drone
+ Mech
+ Composites

Of course, plenty of other types of factories exist on a smaller scale but are not relevant to the game. All three types require power to operate, Drone and Mech factories also require a pattern and appropriate materials.

! **Drone** and **Mech** factories require **1.0 TW** to operate. Assuming they get this (and the necessary materials), they can complete one Build order in a cycle.

! A **Composites** factory produces composties in batches of **1.0KT**. It can produce a number of batches in a cycle equal to **(Power provided in TW, squared, then rounded down)**.

! A Drone or Mech factory costs **3000cr**, **4.5kt of Iron**, **0.5kt of Gold**
! A Composites factory costs **2500cr**, **7.0kt of Titanium**, **0.2kt of Diamonds**

### Atmospheric Shield

A planetary or lunar shield provides protection against orbital bombardment and unauthorised landing. A lunar shield needs at least **1.5 TW** to operate, a planetary shield, **5 TW**. They can both be strengthened with additional power (up to 3 TW and 8 TW).

! A planetary shield costs **3.5kt of Copper**, **17.5kt of Gold**, **5.0kt of Silver**
! A lunar shield costs **3.5kt of Copper**, **3.5kt of Gold**, **1.0kt of Silver**

### Leisure Complex

A leisure complex reduces the revolt risk of the territory it is built it, and doesn't require power. They could be anything from a big entertainment district, to a winter-sports hub, to a simply investment in infrastructure in tourist areas.

! A leisure complex reduces the revolt risk in its territory by **2%**.

! A leisure complex costs **21000cr**

### Temple

Temples to the [Faith](/religion) are usually large works of art and impressive architecture; simple but grand, elegant. A fine temple will make a territory a pilgrimage location for adherents of the faith, and increases the population growth rate of the territory.

! A temple increases the growth rate of its territory by **2%**.

! A temple costs **14000cr**
