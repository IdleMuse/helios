# Orbitals

Orbitals, aptly-named, live in orbit of planets (or large moons). As well as being of core importance to org operations, they represent a certain status - building large orbitals above a planet's surface is hard, and can only be done if an org controls territory on the planet below. Each of the main types of Orbital can do different things:

### Spacedock

A spacedock is big, floating shipyard, for constructing new vessels, and the ship parts to go in them. They tend to be busy places, as most orgs try to be making new ships as often as they can. Ships can be constructed in a Spacedock with a [Build Ships](/orders/build-ships) order, which needs a Ship Pattern to be specified for the shipyards to make.

Spacedocks need materials to work, which can be taken from its own storage, org ships in orbit of the same planet, or from the planet surface.

For more information on building ships, see [Ships](/ships)

! Regular Spacedocks cost 12.0kt Titanium, 2.8kt Composites, 4.5kt Iron, 2.2kt Silver

### Research lab

Research labs are where the vast majority of Science is done in Helios. Surface labs do exist, but they are primarily concerned with minor developments 'below the abstraction layer' such as cleaner water supplies, or stronger fabrics. Orbital research labs are needed for science relevant to the game.

Science is done in research labs with the two main science orders: [Research discipline](/orders/research-discipline) and [Develop technology](/orders/develop-technology). For the latter, a **Theory** is required to develop, which, for a player-owned lab, could come from that lab's research, from your org, or anywhere else you might obtain a theory.

For a more in-depth explanation of the R&D process, see [Science](/science).

! Research Labs cost 15.0kt Titanium, 5.0kt Copper, 3.2kt Silver, 1.5kt Gold, 0.2kt Diamonds

### Wrecking yard

Probably the rarest of the four types of orbitals detailed here, not all orgs consider wrecking yards to be useful. They are usually sprawling in nature, often quite dangerous to navigate near, with a certain breed of independance among those who choose to work there, stripping down ships for parts, or raw materials.

Two types of orders can be given to a wrecking yard: [Strip down](/orders/strip-down) and [Scavenge for technology](/orders/scavenge-technology). For the former, any type of ship or wreck is needed. For the latter, the ship or wreck must be from another org.

Stripping down a vessel or a wreck recovers a portion of the materials used to construct it. Scavenging an unusual vessel for technology unknown to you might result in a new discovery, if the org who made the ship is more advanced than you.

! Stripping down a ship returns 60% of the materials used to build it. Stripping down a wreck returns between 10% and 40%
!
! Scavenging a vessel of an org more advanced from you will generate a new Theory 100% of the time, if it contains a ship part unknown to you, and 10% of the time if not, or 10% and 1% for a wreck.

! Wrecking yards cost 8.5kt Iron, 2.2kt Copper, 4.2kt Titanium

### Fuel station

Fuel stations are quite ubiquitous in Helios and range from polished and cleanly-run operations, to hives of scum and villainy, though they tend towards the latter! They are places where gossip and free trade abound, convenience facilities running alongside the huge refuelling tanks catering for all sorts of independant captains, org personnel, or even pirates.

! A fuel station increases your base income by **800cr/cycle**, with up to **400cr/cycle** additional income depending on the traffic flow through it.

Fuels stations, unlike all other types of orbital, don't need to be in orbit of a planet your org has any control over. Unlike the other types, Fuel stations are often ad hoc constructions, discarded hulks welded together in an ever-increasing ecosystem around the large fuel bladders or tanks.

A player-owned Fuel station starts with an attendant [Small Tanker](/character-creation/enterprises/fuel-station-tanker) on standing orders to shuttle fuel back and forth from [Benu](/planets/benu).

! Fuel Stations cost 20kt in any combination of Iron, Copper, Titanium, Composites
