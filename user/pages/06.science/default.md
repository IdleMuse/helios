# Science

The core elements of 'Science' in Helios are called **Technologies**. Each technology either allows an org to do something more effectively, or enables them do something differently. Examples include: increasing the amount of Composites a factory can produce, or, being able to construct a new type of ship.

Technologies differ from [**Policies**](/orders/adopt_policy) in that policies are not universal - they are specific to the organisational structure of that org. Additionally, technologies cannot (normally) be 'forgotten', whereas policies can be revoked.

Technologies are adopted by each org individually, and only orgs can 'learn' a technology. They can be [traded](/order/trade_with_org) or gifted to other orgs, but this is rare; advanced technology is how each org keeps their foot in the marketplace and the technology race is foremost in the minds of many who control them. Obtaining ideas of what opposing orgs are researching is the primary goal of most inter-org espionage.

### Disciplines

Science is divided into six broad disciplines:
- Materials
- Energetics
- Weapons
- Engineering
- Biotechnology
- AI

All technologies belong to one of these six fields; the extent to which an org has researched a particular discipline will potentially unlock more and more advanced technologies, though hyper-specialisation will prevent access to those types of technologies that require good understandings of multiple fields.

##### Materials

This discipline is concerned with making tougher, more adaptable, or more efficient materials, and how those materials can be created and shaped to suit a cornucopia of purposes. It includes such types of technology as mining modules, composites efficiency, ship armour, and construction efficiency.

##### Energetics

The study of energetics covers the creation, transmission, and dispersal of energy, and as such contains technologies such as power plants (both on surface and for capital ships), propulsion systems, and shields.

##### Weapons

Weapons technology in Helios is diverse, though the primary forms of offensive weaponry are beam weapons, and explosive weapons (in the form of torpedoes or bombs). Projectile weaponry is still commonly uses by drones or for personal defense.

The Weapons research discipline also includes advanced scanners.

##### Engineering

Engineering science is where new ship hulls come from, better orbital platforms, planet-side megaprojects, capital ship systems.

##### Biotechnology

An emerging field in Helios, biotechnolgy's firmest application (on the level orgs care about) is in terraforming, which can greatly increase the population potential of planets or large moons. It is also used in hospitals and medical bays.

##### AI

While the capacity to create new AI on the same level as the [Vahana](/orgs/vahana) has been lost, lesser AI are used in many applications, notably for ship computers and drone combat (which comprises the majority of surface conflict).

### Initial technologies

At the beginning of the game, each org will have a pre-researched set of technologies. For the most part, these will overlap, though each org will have variations. Anything simpler than this initial set will be considered to be below the abstraction layer. For example, 'Fire' will not be written up as a technology, nor will 'Steel smelting'. Things that _seem_ like they should be possible with the existing technology level but don't seem to exist can be looked into with a [Feasibility Report](/orders/feasibility-reports) (the result of which may suggest further research)

**For details of initial technologies, see [Technologies](/science/technologies).**

### Research and Development

The process of discovering new technologies is divided into two: **Research**, and **Development**, and is carried out by Research Labs, which are normally a type of orbital station owned either by players or by the org in general.

##### Research

Research is the first part of discovering a new technology. It is the process of discovering what is possible, experimenting with new ideas, discovering the science behind phenomena. It can be either **Directed** research, or **Open** research. Directed research has some goal or idea it is working towards, whereas open research is simply giving free reign to your scientists to work on what they please. Even open research, however, needs to have a defined Discipline to work in, of the six above.

! When given a [Research Order](/orders/research_discipline), a research lab has a base 20% chance to discover a new theory, which will be increased and decreased by various factors. Issuing 'directed' research rather than open research orders may result in a modifier of between -5% and +5% based on how difficult your scientists are finding the direction you wish to go in.
!
! If the research is successful, a 'Theory' paper is produced, detailing the possible new technology. This is the end goal of the **Research** stage.
!
! Each lab that fails to produce a theory instead gives the org a bonus to that type of research next cycle, of base 5%, modified by between -5% and +5% if directed).

!!!! The purpose of the Â±5% modifier for directed research is to give an indication to players how reasonable (or fantastic) the idea they are trying to realise is. Some technology may just not be possible, and without spending a valuable Feasibility Report looking into it, the modifier (which is reported back if the research fails) should give some indication whether a technology in that direction is even possible. That is not to say, of course, that -5% modifiers straight up mean 'this is not possible'...

##### Development

Once a theory has been researched, it needs to be Developed before it can be implemented. This is the process of refining the idea, testing it, making all the adjustments that will integrate it with existing systems, and distributing the blueprints or information. Development of a theory into a technology will usually take several cycles, and can only be done by one lab - multiple labs cannot co-ordinate on the same technology. Development can be halted halfway through and any progress made will be 'saved'. Once a technology has been developed, it takes effect automatically from the next cycle onwards. Some technologies will simply provide additional options; in those cases, a separate order will likely be needed in order to use that option instead of the current one.

! Each theory has a nubmer of 'development points' that need to be put in to complete it (which will normally be known up-front). A lab will produce a base 1000 development points when given a [Development Order](/orders/develop_technology). This base number will be modified by various factors, and then added on to the theory. When the threshold is reached, the technology is completed, and any overflow is saved in that lab for the future. This overflow can't be moved from lab to lab.

##### Research labs

Labs, as explained above, are core to the science process in Helios. They typically exist as orbital stations around planets (or large moons), and cannot be moved. They can be specialised to one discipline, with a [Specialise Lab](/orders/specialise_lab) order, which can only be done by someone with a specialised [science background](/character-creation/backgrounds). Specialised labs have expensive bulky equipment, the cream of the crop of scientists, and unique construction to aid their particular focus.

! Specialised labs are half as good again as their unspecialised versions; with a base 30% chance to discover new theories, and a base 1500 development point production. They cannot, however, do research or development outside their dedicated discipline.

Labs can be captured by enemies. If this occurs while they are researching a theory, the capturing faction gains the produced theory. If this occurs while developing, the capturing faction gains the theory being developed, but not any points that have been put into it (which stay with the original org). Any points produced this cycle are lost. From the next cycle onwards the lab is under the control of the capturing org and may be used as normal.

##### Wreckage

Wrecking yards (a type of [player-owned enterprise](/character-creation/enterprises)) can also aid in research, increasing the chance of discovering theories in subsequent cycles in the same manner as research labs that fail to produce a theory. Hulks of vessels (or gifted vessels) will need to be towed or flown to the wrecking yard to be processed.

! A wrecking yard that strips down a ship or hulk from another faction grants a bonus to subsequent research in each field of up to 10% depending on how advanced the technology in that vessel was beyond your own.
