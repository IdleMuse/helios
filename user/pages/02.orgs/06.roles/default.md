# Roles within an Org

**Roles** are a central aspect to how each org operates. Through their histories, each has come to a system whereby no one person has executive control over the whole faction; instead, control is delegated to different members of the org council.

#### Major roles

Each org has defined the following **major roles**, and though they will be internally named different things, they are essentially the same position; four roles, covering the following areas of responsibility:

+ Fleet operations
+ Science
+ Finances and economy
+ Construction

#### Minor roles

In addition to the major roles, each org has identified a number of **minor roles**, covering the following areas of responsibility:

+ Espionage
+ Diplomacy
+ Civil fleet operations
+ Surface military operations
+ Exploration
+ Resource extraction (mines and asteroids)

In addition to the above minor roles, each planet or large moon can have a **Governor** assigned, which counts as a minor role.

## Assigning Roles

There are strict rules about assigning roles in Helios, brought about by strong traditions and regulations within each org.

! Within an org, the **Major Roles** must be as evenly distributed as possible. This means, if there are four people on an org council, each must have one of the major roles. If there are three, exactly one person must double up. If there are five, one person will not have a major role.
!
! Once major roles have been assigned, **minor roles** may also be assigned. Not all minor roles must be assigned, unlike the major roles. However, minor roles must also be distributed as evenly as possible, so no one person has more than one more role than anyone else. So, with an org council of seven, no-one can have two roles until all seven have one role each (major or minor), and no-one can have three until all seven have two each, if that's possible.
!
! While this sounds complicated, in practice, think of it as 'when we give someone a role, is there someone else who has fewer roles already'. Employees of the org will monitor this situation and inform the council if it becomes 'unbalanced'
!
! Appointments to roles will be made using the standard vote system of the org in question.

#### Absent people and unfilled roles

It is likely that sometimes, council members will be absent from meetings. Additionally, it is not mandatory that minor roles be filled. In both situations, the situation is the same; any orders that would have fallen under the purview of the absent/unfilled role can be completed by the org council in consensus as per the standard voting system for that org council. (for more information, see each [Org](/orgs)).

#### Orders from people outside their role

In situations like this, the formal person 'signing off' on the order will need to be a person not formally assigned to the role, so there are no _actual_ restrictions to who can issue orders. Standard policy for all orgs, however, is to report back to the org council all orders issued by an 'unusual' party, for accountability purposes.

!!!! The purpose of the rules about evenly distributing roles is to ensure that (particularly in the orgs with fairly undemocratic voting systems), no-one turns up and has nothing to do, and gets ignored. Unless an org gets very large, everyone should be responsible for _something_, and the way Orders work, they have the effective final say on what their orders are.
