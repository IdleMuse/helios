# Fenris Systems

### History

Fenris Systems are a conglomerate in the truest sense of the word. Funded by dynastic banking families, the corporation bought out, or merged with, all of its competitors, and paid its way into being one of the oldest Orgs in the system. No orbital station doesn't have some small part that bears the Fenris logo, no ship is entirely untouched by their advances in design and technology. They were the first org to buy out a whole planet ([Nexus I](/planets/nexus)).

In **290 FF**, the Colonial Navy, driven by its leader's concerns about Fenris' growing private navy, made a rapid strike intervention deep into Fenris-patrolled space, destroying shipyards and communications arrays. However, Fenris were not unprepared for such action, and their swarms of small fighters ripped through the aging Colonial Navy fleet, culminating in the destruction of their flagship. All in all, the war was short but vicious, and cemented the status of Fenris as a mega-org in the Helios system, and cemented a distrust between orgs in general, that continues to this day.

### Aesthetic and culture

Fenris technology tends to the aggressive, their signature fighter ships featuring aggressive angles and sharp lines, oftne in the org's purple colour-scheme. Formal org building, orbitals, (and offices) tend to be grey and well-appointed, if not particularly flashy. Non-combat vessels can seem a bit blocky, but are always efficiently-designed.

The corporate culture of Fenris Systems is one of privacy and profit. Much of their operations are kept highly secret; even at times from other members of the org. As long as those operations are profitable, no questions need to be asked. Directors are expected to keep their own confidence as long as it is in furtherence of the goals of the company. No doubt there are many divisions that are kept 'off-the-books' for various reasons; the Fenris philosophy is that only those who need to know should know.

### Notable holdings

Fenris Systems control a small cluster of planets around ([Nexus I, II, and III](/planets/nexus)), but have widespread interests throughout the system. They maintain a sizeable fleet of ships, primarily smaller rather than larger.

### Voting policy
The Board has a simple system for determining consensus; simple (open) votes are taken, usually framed in the form of 'aye or nay' votes. A simple majority (51%) of those present is required for consensus.

### Costume
As with all the factions, no costume is required. The basic costume cue is 'black suits, black shirts'. For those who want a low-effort yet appropriate costume, a simple black button-up shirt or blouse is perfectly fine. For a bit more effort, think future-city-bankers in black suits with black shirts and black ties (or variations on that theme). Formal and sophisticated yet functional.
