# Fenris Systems

### History

Fenris Systems are a conglomerate in the truest sense of the word. Funded by dynastic banking families, the corporation bought out, or merged with, all of its competitors, and paid its way into being one of the oldest Orgs in the system. No orbital station doesn't have some small part that bears the Fenris logo, no ship is entirely untouched by their advances in design and technology. They were the first org to buy out a whole planet ([Nexus](/planets/nexus)).

Much of their operations are kept highly secret; even at times from other members of the org. Directors are expected to keep their own confidence as long as it is in furtherence of the Goals of the Company. No doubt there are many divisions that are kept 'off-the-books' for various reasons; the Fenris philosophy is that only those who need to know should know.

### Voting policy
The Board has a simple system for determining consensus; simple (open) votes are taken, usually framed in the form of 'aye or nay' votes. A simple majority (51%) of those present is required for consensus.

### Costume
As with all the factions, no costume is required. The basic costume cue is 'black suits, black shirts'. For those who want a low-effort yet appropriate costume, a simple black button-up shirt or blouse is perfectly fine. For a bit more effort, think future-city-bankers in black suits with black shirts and black ties (or variations on that theme). Formal and sophisticated yet functional.
