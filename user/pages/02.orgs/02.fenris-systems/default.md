### Voting policy
The Board has a simple system for determining consensus; simple (open) votes are taken, usually framed in the form of 'aye or nay' votes. A simple majority (51%) of those present is required for consensus.

### Costume
As with all the factions, no costume is required. The basic costume cue is 'black suits, black shirts'. For those who want a low-effort yet appropriate costume, a simple black button-up shirt or blouse is perfectly fine. For a bit more effort, think future-city-bankers in black suits with black shirts and black ties (or variations on that theme). Formal and sophisticated yet functional.
