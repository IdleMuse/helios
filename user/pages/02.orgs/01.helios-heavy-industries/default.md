# Helios Heavy Industries

### History

### Aesthetic

### Notable holdings

### Vocabulary
The Org Council of Helios Heavy Industries is known as the **Ruling Council**

The player in charge of the fleet is known as the **Operations Executive**

Helios Heavy Industries capital ships are not traditionally prefixed with anything, although there is a new tradition of prefixing them with "**_Meru_**" for their home planet (when built there). Example: the _Meru Thor_.

### Voting policy
The Helios Heavy Industries Ruling Council has adopted a rule whereby all decisions where the council in whole needs to be consulted are decided by a vote of those present. However, unlike some other orgs, they require a qualified majority (of 66% of those voting) to pass a resolution.

### Costume
As with all the factions, no costume is required; for players who wish to look the part, the suggested basic costume for Helios Heavy Industries employees is a simple white labcoat. For those who want to make more of an effort, the aesthetic suggested for elaborations on that is modern Indian formal-wear, high collars and straight lines (under a labcoat, of course).
