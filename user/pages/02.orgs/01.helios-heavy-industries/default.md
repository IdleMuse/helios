# Helios Heavy Industries

### History

Helios Heavy Industries formed out of the numerous small ship-building (and weapon-building) corporations that grew up in orbit of Meru. The relatively early and easy colonisation of the moon of Meru, combined with their bounty in minerals, meant that Meruvian industry fed the continuing growth of humanity in the first century of human occupation in Helios. 

As competition from belt-based co-operatives grew, many of those rival manufacturers ended up banding together for scientific advancement, hoping to beat the nascent Fenris Systems and Miner's Guild companies with superior technology in their ships. Eventually, Helios Heavy Industries, as the resulting conglomerate was called, was the first org to construct 'new' capital ships (as opposed to the Colonial Navy frigates that arrived in Helios with the [ark ships](/history)).

Today, the org is dominant in its control of manufacturing in Meru's orbit, and has plans to expand into the belt planets too. Its headquarters, the _Olympia_, is a huge orbital (around Meru III), named for the Ark ship that brought people to this part of the system, the remains of which (now much-scavenged) are still visible, and a frequent tourist attraction.

### Aesthetic and culture

![](hhi.png?resize=400&class=floatright)
Helios Heavy Industries technology is traditionally designed with clean, smooth lines. Their ships are protected by pure white ceramic armour carapaces, as are their mechs and drones. They build things with circles, curves, not so much organic as ergonomic. Form and function go hand-in-hand; whether in a consumer appliance, or a delicate yet deadly repeating plasma railgun 200m long.

Where appropriate, the org uses a circluar golden sun symbol, though this is not as common as simply the letters **HHI**.

Culturally, the Meru value their relatively utopian homemoons, and are strong patrons of arts, science, and culture. The Faith is based on Meru IV, the system-wide religion. A philosophy of perfection in thought and action is promoted throughout the org and its subsidiaries.

### Notable holdings

At game start, HHI control three of the five 'large moons' around Meru - the three largest, Meru II, Meru III, and Meru IV. These moons are rich, abundant in minerals, and popular in tourism.

They own several capital ships, the largest of which is the _Meru Hephaestus_, a massive mobile stardock, capable of construction new ships on-board, a unique achievement to date.

### Vocabulary
The Org Council of Helios Heavy Industries is known as the **Ruling Council**

The player in charge of the fleet is known as the **Operations Director**

The player in charge of financial affairs is known as the **Fiscal Director**

The player in charge of science is known as the **Research Director**

The player in charge of construction is known as the **Construction Director**

Helios Heavy Industries capital ships are not traditionally prefixed with anything, although there is a new tradition of prefixing them with "**_Meru_**" for their home planet (when built there). Example: the _Meru Thor_.

### Voting policy
The Helios Heavy Industries Ruling Council has adopted a rule whereby all decisions where the council in whole needs to be consulted are decided by a vote of those present. However, unlike some other orgs, they require a qualified majority (of 66% of those voting) to pass a resolution.

### Costume
As with all the factions, no costume is required; for players who wish to look the part, the suggested basic costume for Helios Heavy Industries employees is a simple white labcoat. For those who want to make more of an effort, the aesthetic suggested for elaborations on that is modern Indian formal-wear, high collars and straight lines (under a labcoat, of course).
