### Voting policy
Where other orgs have systems of voting to determine consensus in situation where disagreements occur, The Colonial Navy has a simpler solution. Sometimes called the '1%' system by those critical of it, all decisions are left to the sole responsibility of the officer in charge of that area. Any decisions for which there is not an officer with responsibility over that domain are left up to the Grand Admiral of the Fleet to decide, a position which correspondingly accords a lot of power.

One exception to this is the nomination of the primary four roles (see [Roles within an org](/orgs/roles)). In [insert year here], the Grand Admiral of the time, [name here], fired the rest of the board, installed cronies, and began a disastrous war in Fenris Systems space, which crippled the Colonial Fleet (one outcome of which was the permanent destruction of their ancient dreadnought flagship _CF Coronus_, an irreplaceable loss). Since then, the primary roles have been nominated by one another to prevent an instantaneous coup.

The Grand Admiral of the Fleet is nominated by the Navy Secretary  
The Navy Secretary is nominated by the Strategic Development Commander  
The Strategic Development Commander is nominated by the Chief of Naval Research  
The Chief of Naval Research is nominated by the Grand Admiral of the Fleet  

All the **Minor Roles** are nominated by the Grand Admiral of the fleet, with the exception of the officer in charge of Exploration, which is nominated by the Chief of Naval Research, and the officer in charge of mining, which is nominated by the Strategic Development Commander.

### Costume
As with all the factions, no costume is required. The 'basic' costume for the Colonial Navy, for players who want to wear some costume, is a plain white button-up shirt, and if possible, a fancy military/naval hat. Any style is appropriate; the Colonial Navy isn't really a strict hierarchy any more, and there are hundreds of different ranks and departments you might choose to wear the 'official headwear of rank' of.

For people who want to go all-out on costume, think full naval or sci-fi military officer; greatcoats, epaulettes, boots, sidearms, anywhere from modern navy Admiral to 40k Commissar.
