# Colonial Navy

### History

The Colonial Navy has existed since before humans arrived in Helios. Along with the three Ark ships in the great expedition, a small fleet of ships was sent alongside, headed by the massive _Coronus_. While the vahana took care of the ark ships proper, the naval fleet escort was operated by naval personnel on rotation from Deep Sleep. When the fleet arrived in the Helios system, with no need for naval superiority, the majority of the colonial fleet was abandoned, mothballed, with the crew descending planetside to form colonies as with the rest of the travellers, in this instance forming very militaristic communities with some notable success.

However, as new shuttles and ships began to be built by these first-generation colonists, and communications and trade between these naval communities grew up, it became clear that not all the new human inhabitants of Helios were keen on collaboration. Piracy of the nascent interplanetary trade was rife, and the first attempts at building orbital platforms were sabotaged for valuable parts by pirates. As such, the leaders of all the naval colonies came together and decided to reactivate the aged colonial fleet to protect their sovereign space. This meeting was the first of many that would evolve into the Naval Command known today.

This policy of protectionism has been taken to extremes at times - see below for details of the embarassing war against Fenris Systems, started in **290 FF** as a reaction to the increasing militarism of that org, which a particular faction of the Navy saw as a direct threat to their authority.

### Aesthetic and culture

The Colonial Naval vessels are all designed and painted in naval blue according to the rigid guidelines passed down through the _Ship's Regulations_, the document maintained down from when they arrived in the system originally. Technology has obviously advanced a fair bit since then, though, so some parts have to be... interpreted. Easily-identifiable markings on the hull of ships indicates their precise role and rank within the navy.

Insignia-wise, they tend towards the eagles-and-skulls motif, variously-arranged.

Inside ships, naval design is clean and simple, designed primarily for ease of use. As with all the orgs, the Colonial Navy has expanded beyond its roots, and now does far more than just maintain their fleet - Colonial-Navy-produced goods are valued for their simplicity and usefullness, particularly for the price, and many new settlements across the system will depend on their survival equipment to maintain poorly-resourced and rarely-visited townships and villages.

Among all the orgs, they have also put some of the most effort into _founding_ new colonies, and exploring new frontiers. Their no-nonsense attitude is attractive to a lot of independent pilots who are keen to make their mark on the system, and sign up as scouts or fighter pilots.

### Notable holdings

The Colonial Navy maintains a lot of ships, including several capital ships (more details to follow) of varying ages. The current flagship is the _CF Audax_.

Planetwise, the Navy have holdings on several planets around one side of the belt (primarily those where they maintain shipyards), and are actively acquiring more. They also control (by force) some sections of the asteroid belt.

### Vocabulary
The Org Council of the Colonial Navy is known as the **Naval Command**

The player in charge of the fleet is known as the **Grand Admiral of the Fleet**

The player in charge of financial affairs is known as the **Navy Secretary**

The player in charge of science is known as the **Chief of Naval Research**

The player in charge of construction is known as the **Strategic Development Commander**

Capital ships of the Colonial Navy are traditionally prefixed "**_CF_**" for _Colonial Fleet_, and tend to be named in latin, often after animals.

### Voting policy
Where other orgs have systems of voting to determine consensus in situation where disagreements occur, The Colonial Navy has a simpler solution. Sometimes called the '1%' system by those critical of it, all decisions are left to the sole responsibility of the officer in charge of that area. Any decisions for which there is not an officer with responsibility over that domain are left up to the Grand Admiral of the Fleet to decide, a position which correspondingly accords a lot of power.

One exception to this is the nomination of the primary four roles (see [Roles within an org](/orgs/roles)). In [290](/history), the Grand Admiral of the time, Flag Admiral Vestus Flavius, fired the rest of the board, installed cronies, and began a disastrous war in Fenris Systems space, which crippled the Colonial Fleet (one outcome of which was the permanent destruction of their ancient dreadnought flagship _CF Coronus_, an irreplaceable loss). Since then, the primary roles have been nominated by one another to prevent an instantaneous coup.

The Grand Admiral of the Fleet is nominated by the Navy Secretary  
The Navy Secretary is nominated by the Strategic Development Commander  
The Strategic Development Commander is nominated by the Chief of Naval Research  
The Chief of Naval Research is nominated by the Grand Admiral of the Fleet  

All the **Minor Roles** are nominated by the Grand Admiral of the fleet, with the exception of the officer in charge of Exploration, which is nominated by the Chief of Naval Research, and the officer in charge of mining, which is nominated by the Strategic Development Commander.

### Costume
As with all the factions, no costume is required. The 'basic' costume for the Colonial Navy, for players who want to wear some costume, is a plain white button-up shirt, and if possible, a fancy military/naval hat. Any style is appropriate; the Colonial Navy isn't really a strict hierarchy any more, and there are hundreds of different ranks and departments from which you might be wearing the 'official headwear of rank'.

For people who want to go all-out on costume, think full naval or sci-fi military officer; greatcoats, epaulettes, boots, sidearms, anywhere from modern navy Admiral to 40k Commissar.
