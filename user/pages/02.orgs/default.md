# The five major Orgs

Though forms of terrestrial government vary across each colonised planet, moon, and asteroid, no single planet can muster the resources to conduct extensive interplanetary operations; instead, the large-scale activities in the system are the domain of the Orgs. Five in number, these massive entities between them control most resource production, manufacturing, exploration, and transport across the whole Helios system. Thousands of times larger than any small corporation, even those with interests spread across several moons, these orgs have hugely varied portfolios, each one of them with hundreds of subsidiaries and thousands of employees.

While ostensibly at peace with one another, the orgs compete fiercely for resources, and maintain various degrees of naval capacity, ostensibly to deal with rogue governments, or pirate fleets.

#### [Helios Heavy Industries](/orgs/helios-heavy-industries)

Based on the five moons of [Meru](/planets/meru), the middle of the three gas giants. Helios Heavy Industries are primarily a naval and military tech manufactuer, though like all the major orgs, their operations are hugely varied. Helios technology, including ships, is recognisable by their smooth white colour-scheme, including ceramic carapaces on their ships and characteristic combat mechs. The relative prosperity of Meru's moons (Meru itself is a major fuel source for smaller craft that don't use nuclear engines) means that Helios citizens are often viewed with jealousy from other, less-idyllic parts of the system.

#### [Fenris Systems](/orgs/fenris-systems)

Of all the orgs, Fenris would like to claim that they are the foremost in research and development, though of course nobody actually know for certain; all sides keep their cutting-edge tech close to their chests. As with all the orgs, they maintain mining and shipping operations in the belt, their purple insignia a common one seen on classes of ship all the way from small freighters up to capital ships.

Fenris also maintain the [Maze](/culture), and have made significant contributions to mass communications technology, largely to aid in their extensive banking operations.

#### [The Colonial Navy](/orgs/colonial-navy)

Not strictly a corporation, the Colonial Navy is the remnants of the fleet that escorted humankind to the Helios system, ready to protect it against potential danger. Today, it is largely similar to the other orgs, with mining, research, and energy assets, among others, on top of their (now aging) naval fleet. From its origins, it retains a blue colour scheme, a fondness for regimented formality, and military ranks and titles. For more info on the original colonisation of the system, see [History](/history)

#### [The Miner's Guild](/orgs/miners-guild)

More informal than the Navy, more practical than Fenris, less polished than Helios Heavy Industries, The Miner's Guild has its roots in minersâ€™ unions, leagues, and co-operatives that formed in order to buy ore bulk from freelance miners and sell it on the open market. As time went on, the same people came to control and merge these organisations until one huge parent org was formed. In terms of total displacement of ships, they probably outweigh the other orgs, but focus largely on mining, exploration, and trading, their gold colour scheme easily recognisable. Many Guild captains are only loosely affiliated with the org, simply out of convenience.

The ore mined by its members is sold on their behalf by the Guild on the [Floor](/economy), essentially a huge auction house and trading floor on the planet [First Fall](/planets/first-fall/)

#### [The Vahana](/orgs/vahana)

There are few people left who remember the [Migration](/history), but records show that the Vahana were created to guide and assist the migration fleet on its way to the Helios system. Since then, though, they have developed and expanded largely independently, to the point where they now control space and resources on par with any of the other orgs. Though their artifical nature means their planetary requirements differ somewhat from humankind, they employ enough humans that their ships and installations are designed around both, though they have not the human predilection for colour. Most of their tech is left a matte black, as are their own expressionless exoskeletons.
