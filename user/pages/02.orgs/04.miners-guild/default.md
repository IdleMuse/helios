# Miner's Guild

### History

### Aesthetic and culture

![](guild.png?class=floatright&resize=200)
The Miner's Guild rarely build truly 'new' things - even newly-commissioned ships are largely reconstructed from scrap parts, half-built projects, or one-off designs. As a result, the guild doesn't exactly have a unified aesthetic, mostly being uneven, under constant rebuild, or fixed-up. Where possible, they try to paint their ships with 'guild yellow', a sort of golden colour that stands up well to abuse, but this is by no means universal. The more formal Guild ships that have been produced from scratch have been quite utilitarian and blocky.

Miner's Guild bases tend to be oily, but well-run. The anti-hierarchical nature of the org means that things from orbital to oribtal, planet to planet tend to be done in different ways, and the local supervisor is always happy to sit down and have a cuppa with you and explain their new ways of doing things that is actually 110% as efficient as the way it was done before she came on board. The culture is one of hardiness, inclusivity, and practical innovation.

### Notable holdings

The headquarters of the Miner's Guild is on [First Fall](/planets/first-fall), a largely barren planet near to the asteroid belt, which the Guild has considerable holdings in. They also control a couple of other planets around the outside of the belt.

Ship-wise, the Guild doesn't have any capital ships, but it maintains a collection of other vessels, most of which are kitted out for some sort of mining or freighting activity.

More to come.

### Vocabulary
The Org Council of the Miner's Guild is technically called the **Committee**, although they are generally very casual.

This casual attitude extends to the major roles within the org, none of which have formal names...

The player in charge of the fleet might be known as **Am√©lie, the one who you go to if you've been attacked by pirates**

The player in charge of financial affairs might be known as **Dave, you give him all your reciepts**

The player in charge of science might be known as **The lady over there with her head in a book**

The player in charge of construction might be known as the **Jem, she knows how all this stuff actually works**

Capital ships of the Miner's Guild are traditionally prefixed "**_GS_**" for _Guild Ship_, though often they weren't actually owned by the org originally, so are named at the whim of their owners, or they bear the older "**_GMS_**" for _Guildmaster's Ship_, back when there was a formal Guildmaster.

### Voting policy
The Miner's Guild has a long history in worker's collectives, small co-operative firms, and democratically-run enterprises. As such, all decisions that are to be put to a vote are decided by means of a secret ballot. A simple majority (51%) is required to pass.

### Costume
As with all factions, no costume is required. For those who wish to create a simple costume, however, the basic outfit for the Miner's Guild is a boiler suit, any colour. For those who wish to spend a bit more time on costume, elaborations on that theme might include engineers toolbelts or baldrics, a light smearing of oil, holey tshirts under the boiler suit, that sort of thing. The idea is that no-one in the guild particularly cares for appearances, and they all either have their own ships, or have backgrounds in engineering, mining, or similar - they tend to be the 'rough and ready' sort.
