# Miner's Guild

### History

### Aesthetic

### Notable holdings

### Vocabulary
The Org Council of the Miner's Guild is technically called the **Committee**, although they are generally very casual.

This casual attitude extends to the major roles within the org, none of which have formal names...

The player in charge of the fleet might be known as **Am√©lie, the one who you go to if you've been attacked by pirates**

The player in charge of financial affairs might be known as **Dave, you give him all your reciepts**

The player in charge of science might be known as **The lady over there with her head in a book**

The player in charge of construction might be known as the **Jem, she knows how all this stuff actually works**

Capital ships of the Miner's Guild are traditionally prefixed "**_GS_**" for _Guild Ship_, though often they weren't actually owned by the org originally, so are named at the whim of their owners, or they bear the older "**_GMS_**" for _Guildmaster's Ship_, back when there was a Guildmaster.

### Voting policy
The Miner's Guild has a long history in worker's collectives, small co-operative firms, and democratically-run enterprises. As such, all decisions that are to be put to a vote are decided by means of a secret ballot. A simple majority (51%) is required to pass.

### Costume
As with all factions, no costume is required. For those who wish to create a simple costume, however, the basic outfit for the Miner's Guild is a boiler suit, any colour. For those who wish to spend a bit more time on costume, elaborations on that theme might include engineers toolbelts or baldrics, a light smearing of oil, holey tshirts under the boiler suit, that sort of thing. The idea is that no-one in the guild particularly cares for appearances, and they all either have their own ships, or have backgrounds in engineering, mining, or similar - they tend to be the 'rough and ready' sort.
