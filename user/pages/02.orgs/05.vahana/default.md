# The Vahana

### History

### Aesthetic and culture

The Vahana tend to be very secretive about their technology. When examined by other orgs, it has often proved impossible to open and examine, let along reverse-engineer. Typically, Vahana ships, orbitals, and equipment tends to be matte-black, very hard-wearing, with very minimalist markings. Their personal endurance makes them ideal settlers on hazardous worlds, and their technology is built to match that, competing with Navy equipment for dominance of the frontier market.

As Vahana are able to communicate with each other at fairly long distances, as well as being adept multi-taskers, structures designed for them are strangely distributed, without central command rooms, meeting spaces, and so forth, except where designed to facilitate human usage. Most vahana structures are supplied with air (or are able to be flooded with it) for human usage if necessary.

### Notable holdings

The Vahana are known to have constructed several capital ships, and have numerous orbitals around the system, several of which are capable of producing ships. However, their shuos are rarely actually seen around Helios, so their true number is a bit of a mystery.

They control several planets near to the zeta sector of the asteroid belt, with a mix of human and vahana inhabitants.

More to come.

### Vocabulary
The Org Council of the Vahana is known as **The Hive**, although this is also used at times to refer to the general distributed intelligence of the Vahana as a whole.

The player in charge of the fleet is known as the **Navigator Prime**

The player in charge of financial affairs is known as the **Economic Controller**

The player in charge of science is known as the **R&D Division Leader**

The player in charge of construction is known as the **Production Controller**

Capital ships of the Vahana are traditionally prefixed "**_V._**" for _Vahana_

### Voting policy
The philosophy of the Vahana doesn't particularly allow for discord. Any disagreement among the Hive must be rectified. Any situation which requires a vote requires unanimity in order to pass. In other words, any time formal agreement of the Hive is needed, 100% of Vahana present must 'vote' in favour in order for such an agreement to be made.

### Costume
Costume for the Vahana is at once both largely irrelevant (as they normally meet only online!) and actually quite difficult. If a Vahana ever needs (or wants) to appear 'in person' at an event (there may be specific events outside the normal sessions that could prompt this), they (like all factions), do not need to wear a costume. However, if you do wish to physrep being a Vahana with a costume, the suggested 'costume' with which to emulate their expressionless 'faces' and general appearance is a dark grey or black morph-suit. Over the top of that, grey or black clothing can be worn with, suitably 'greebled' to look robotic in nature to any extent you wish. Vahana do not typically wear 'clothes' - clothes worn over a morph-suit should emulate parts of their 'skin' or exoskeleton, which may include elements like artificial muscle fibres, cables, or lighting.

I appreciate that this is fairly aspirational as kit goes - there is not a simple 'basic physrep' you can wear that really encapsulates the Vahana look. Hopefully this isn't too much of a problem, as they primarily meet online anyway! And as with all of Helios, no costume is strictly required; these are simply ideas for players who want to put costume effort in.
