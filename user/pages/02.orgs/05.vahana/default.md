# The Vahana

### History

### Aesthetic

### Notable holdings

### Vocabulary
The Org Council of the Vahana is known as **The Hive**, although this is also used at times to refer to the general distributed intelligence of the Vahana as a whole.

The player in charge of the fleet is known as the **Navigator Prime**

The player in charge of financial affairs is known as the **Economic Controller**

The player in charge of science is known as the **R&D Division Leader**

The player in charge of construction is known as the **Production Controller**

Capital ships of the Vahana are traditionally prefixed "**_V._**" for _Vahana_

### Voting policy
The philosophy of the Vahana doesn't particularly allow for discord. Any disagreement among the Hive must be rectified. Any situation which requires a vote requires unanimity in order to pass. In other words, any time formal agreement of the Hive is needed, 100% of Vahana present must 'vote' in favour in order for such an agreement to be made.

### Costume
Costume for the Vahana is at once both largely irrelevant (as they normally meet only online!) and actually quite difficult. If a Vahana ever needs (or wants) to appear 'in person' at an event (there may be specific events outside the normal sessions that could prompt this), they (like all factions), do not need to wear a costume. However, if you do wish to physrep being a Vahana with a costume, the suggested 'costume' with which to emulate their expressionless 'faces' and general appearance is a dark grey or black morph-suit. Over the top of that, grey or black clothing can be worn with, suitably 'greebled' to look robotic in nature to any extent you wish. Vahana do not typically wear 'clothes' - clothes worn over a morph-suit should emulate parts of their 'skin' or exoskeleton.

I appreciate that this is fairly aspirational as kit goes - there is not a simple 'basic physrep' you can wear that really encapsulates the Vahana look. Hopefully this isn't too much of a problem, as they primarily meet online anyway! And as with all of Helios, no costume is require; these are simply ideas for players who want to put costume effort in.
