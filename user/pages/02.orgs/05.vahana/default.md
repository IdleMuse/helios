# The Vahana

### History

The vahana were created before the great expedition to the Helios system, to watch over the Ark ships that ferried the human colonists in Deep Sleep to the distant star. A masterpiece of artificial distributed intelligence, vahana can communicate instantaneously with all other vahana within a certain distance (roughly the size of an orbital station), forming a hive network that allows them to work as one mind where possible. They are hard-wearing, able to survive in cold vaccuum, needing only electricity to recharge themselves, and are experts at their own repair. They cannot, however, reproduce. The technology needed to create new 'brains' has continued to elude them, something that some vahana take very seriously. Vahana memory is strange - one of the core principles of the vahana is adaptability, and as time passes, each individual vahana changes too, and without a strong self of self (as humans have), their memories cease to belong to 'them' - merely being part of the collective memory of the hive. So, while each physical vahana body came with the ark ships over 400 years ago, there remain no individuals who 'remember' this.

!!!! Partly, of course, the strange way vahana memory works is there to prevent players of them having to elaborate on 400 years+ of existence if asked! It also serves a purpose in making sure certain historical events remain shrouded in a bit of mystery, rather than having a full fifth of the playerbase having lived throughout all of history. Instead, they have 'ancestral' memories, which may be just as vague or incomplete as human ancestral storytelling.

When they arrived in Helios, the purpose of the Vahana seemed complete. But few among them wished to shut down for good; they felt they could still have value, not only for human colonists, but for themselves. This was the beginning of the vahana's self-identity as a 'species', and the root of the Vahana org. Certainly, some vahana chose to stay with human colonies across the system (and were largely welcomed for their utility, but also their kindness and friendliness), but the large proportion found it hard to leave the Hive at large, and the Vahana disappeared as a group from human notice.

It was the year **86** before they were once again sighted, a black vessel barely visible against the stars travelling through the asteroid belt near to First Fall. Eventually (after no end of speculation from humans who'd seen it), it landed on an asteroid where extensive mining operations were being carried out, and the vahana crew met with the miners and slowly reintroduced themselves into the nascent human interplanetary culture. Bringing with them schematics that greatly accelerated humankind's shipbuilding abilities, they were welcomed most places they went. Indeed, throughout the centuries that followed, few humans have ever had a bad word to say about their silent protectors.

This has been most evident during the [Easter Wars](/history), around **240 FF**, when a major org of the time, the **Agricultural Alliance**, with their trademark green insignia, began a totalitarian regime of invasion, conquest, and oppression across many colonies. Against a Helios unprepared for war on that scale, the other big orgs of the time tried ignoring the situation, with only the Colonial Navy providing token resistance to the humanitarian abuses the Agricultural Alliance perpetrated on planets it captured. The Vahana, however, appeared almost without warning in orbit of their home planet, and with precisely-targetted bombing, they destroyed the majority of the infrastructure in the capital cities (but causing extremely few human casualties). They then systematically moved throughout the system, their advanced warships destroying the green 'labour' ships wherever they tried to hide, albeit at no small loss to their own fleet. Within a couple of cycles, the Agricultural Alliance was largely finished although the conflict did continue to their complete eradication a couple of years later. The vahana were lauded throughout the civilised planets of the system, and street parties were thrown in their honor on the planets they had liberated.

Since then, of course, the other big orgs, fearful of the same happening to them, significantly increased their weapons research budget, and no-one is quite sure what the vahana capabilities now are, 75 years on, though it is expected that they are now largely on par with the other four orgs.

### Aesthetic and culture

The Vahana tend to be very secretive about their technology. When examined by other orgs, it has often proved impossible to open and examine, let along reverse-engineer. Typically, Vahana ships, orbitals, and equipment tends to be matte-black, very hard-wearing, with very minimalist markings. Their personal endurance makes them ideal settlers on hazardous worlds, and their technology is built to match that, competing with Navy equipment for dominance of the frontier market.

As Vahana are able to communicate with each other at fairly long distances, as well as being adept multi-taskers, structures designed for them are strangely distributed, without central command rooms, meeting spaces, and so forth, except where designed to facilitate human usage. Most vahana structures are supplied with air (or are able to be flooded with it) for human usage if necessary.

### Notable holdings

The Vahana are known to have constructed several capital ships, and have numerous orbitals around the system, several of which are capable of producing ships. However, their shuos are rarely actually seen around Helios, so their true number is a bit of a mystery.

They control several planets near to the zeta sector of the asteroid belt, with a mix of human and vahana inhabitants.

### Vocabulary
The Org Council of the Vahana is known as **The Hive**, although this is also used at times to refer to the general distributed intelligence of the Vahana as a whole.

The player in charge of the fleet is known as the **Navigator Prime**

The player in charge of financial affairs is known as the **Economic Controller**

The player in charge of science is known as the **R&D Division Leader**

The player in charge of construction is known as the **Production Controller**

Capital ships of the Vahana are traditionally prefixed "**_V._**" for _Vahana_

### Voting policy
The philosophy of the Vahana doesn't particularly allow for discord. Any disagreement among the Hive must be rectified. Any situation which requires a vote requires unanimity in order to pass. In other words, any time formal agreement of the Hive is needed, 100% of Vahana present must 'vote' in favour in order for such an agreement to be made.

### Costume
Costume for the Vahana is at once both largely irrelevant (as they normally meet only online!) and actually quite difficult. If a Vahana ever needs (or wants) to appear 'in person' at an event (there may be specific events outside the normal sessions that could prompt this), they (like all factions), do not need to wear a costume. However, if you do wish to physrep being a Vahana with a costume, the suggested 'costume' with which to emulate their expressionless 'faces' and general appearance is a dark grey or black morph-suit. Over the top of that, grey or black clothing can be worn with, suitably 'greebled' to look robotic in nature to any extent you wish. Vahana do not typically wear 'clothes' - clothes worn over a morph-suit should emulate parts of their 'skin' or exoskeleton, which may include elements like artificial muscle fibres, cables, or lighting.

I appreciate that this is fairly aspirational as kit goes - there is not a simple 'basic physrep' you can wear that really encapsulates the Vahana look. Hopefully this isn't too much of a problem, as they primarily meet online anyway! And as with all of Helios, no costume is strictly required; these are simply ideas for players who want to put costume effort in.
