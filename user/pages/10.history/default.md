# History of Helios

**Summary:** Humanity came to the system in three huge ark ships, the _Orpheus_, the _Olypmpia_, and the _Oceanus_, held in deep sleep and looked after by the Vahana. When arriving in the systems, various colonies were established, and the first fifty or sixty years were spent simply adapting to the new environments, building settlements and getting used to life in the new system. After that, technology started to catch up again and interplanetary travel and communications once again became possible.

Around the turn of the second century, it was starting to become clear that certain commerical enterprises were growing significantly in power, and these were dubbed 'orgs', and came to wield more power than most plantery governments. Tension grew higher, culminating in several wars throughout the century that now lead us in to the beginning of the third century of human and vahanakind's inhabitance of the Helios system.
