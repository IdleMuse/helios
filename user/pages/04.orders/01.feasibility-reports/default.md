# Feasibility Reports

Each session, each org can commision one Feasibility Report into any topic they desire. This goes to whichever part of the org is most relevant, who then research the topic, and prepare the report ready for the next session. They may come back and say that whatever was proposed is impossible, or this might indicate that further scientific research is required, or it may be that whatever you asked is simple and just requires the council to say 'yes' to implement.

Commisionning a feasibility report is not an order, and no one person on the council should have responsibility for it - topics to research are decided by the normal democratic method for that org (see each individual org page for details).

A simple example of a Feasibility report request would be into a new type of technology that doesn't yet exist: for instance, teleportation. Usually feasbility reports into technology ideas like that will either return as currently impossible, or clarify an estimate of a certain amount of [scientific research](/science) that is required to breakthrough in this field.

Feasbility reports are not an espionage tool, and can't give exact figures. They're best for asking questions about the _feasibility_ of certain paths or choices. The people compiling the report can't see into the future - they can make predictions about the future, but not guarantee that certain things will or won't happen.

!!!! I want to emphasise here that a feasibility report can be commissioned into literally **anything**. It's the players' gateway into changing things that normally can't be changed within the structure of the normal orders system. Beyond the simple things like science and technology ideas, one might commission a report into changing the structure or focus of an org, improving the output of buildings, the possibility of performing new and different actions, how the population might react to certain events.<br><br>Even if a report is commissioned that the org researchers can't answer - there is a limit to the reach and foresight of the people compiling the report - they can and will advise on how you could actually go about obtaining that information.<br><br>This part of the game really excites me because it's the handle by which players can have really in-depth control over how the game works and plays.
