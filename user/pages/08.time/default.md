# The measurement of Time in Helios

Time in the Helios system is measured in **Cycles**. A cycle is a fifth of a solar cycle for most of the planets around the Helios sun, and is comprised of 100 days (though of course this varies from planet to planet). Each session of the game occurs around the beginning each cycle, so they are roughly 100 in-universe days apart.

The cycles are named:

| Ravi | Soma | Deva | Vajra | Naga |
|::|::|::|::|::|

The commonly-given explanation of where these names come from is that they were some kind of divison system among the Vahana that oversaw humankind's journey to Helios. The Vahana practice of using them to refer to cycles quickly spread to all other interplanetary business, though locals planetside often have their own names or systems.

Days within a cycle are numbered using "universal numerals" (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and so on..), and the years are simply numbered (measured since [First Fall](/history)).

An example date would thus be **XVI Ravi 316**, (the planned date of the first session of Helios!), the 16th day of the first cycle of the 316th year since humans (and vahana) arrived in the Helios system. Years are often suffixed 'FF', meaning 'years since [First Fall](/history)'.
