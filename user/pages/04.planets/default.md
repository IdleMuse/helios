# The Helios System

![](helios-system.png?class=center)

The map above is a simplified overview of the Helios system. At the centre, the large, orange Helios star, surrounded by a dense asteroid belt. Out beyond the asteroid belt, a cornucopia of planets, some with water, and organic life, some barren deserts. On the map above, planets with org-controlled provinces are highlighted in their colour. A solid border around a planet indicates total control of that planet.

Beyond the inner planets lie three gas giants. In order, from nearest to furthest:

**Benu**, a browny-red planet, quite small for a gas giant, valuable as a fuel source for ships moving through the inner planets.

**Meru**, a huge, white gas giant with many moons, five of which are large enough to be considered on a par with inner planets, habitable, with atmospheres.

**Loka Obscura**, a distant gas giant, strangely dark in colour, and cold by nature of its distance from the sun. It is large, larger still than Meru, and is expected to have some large moons, of which two have been observed at a distance, or by unmanned probe, and seem lifeless wastes. Much of Loka Obscura is still a mystery.

Beyond the gas giants lies a field of exoplanets, likely all rocky and uninhabitable, and few and far apart.

### Navigation

!!!! Navigation is, by necessity, a somewhat abstracted and game-ified process. You are not expected to calculate orbital trajectories in order to steer a ship in Helios.

It is relatively easy for ships to move around the inner planets, no matter what size they are. The asteroid field is somewhat denser, being dangerous to pilot large capital ships through, but, provides a faster route for pilots wishing to cross the system. The asteroid belt is divided into six sectors, lettered alpha through zeta, and movement within those sectors isn't precisely tracked.

! Capital ships attempting to traverse the asteroid field have a base 20% chance of taking damage for each sector they move through.

The gas giants are treated similarly to the asteroid belt - each one can be navigated to from anywhere in the inner planets over the course of cycle, though it is slow due to their distance from the belt planets.

### List of Planets

Notable inhabited planets:
+ **First Fall** - the site of the landing of the _Orpheus_, the first Ark ship to arrive in the system, the headquarters of the [Miner's Guild](/orgs/miners-guild) and the location of the [Floor](/economy).
+ **Meru** - the province of [Helios Heavy Industries](/orgs/helios-heavy-industries), particularly **Meru III** (the third moon) above which sits their orbital headquarters, and the graveyard of the Ark ship _Olympia_.
+ **Nexus** - a closely-tied system of three planets, headquarters of [Fenris Systems](/orgs/fenris-systems).

To be extended.

! Celestial bodies in Helios are categories according to the their use in the game, not necessarily to exactly what they orbit - this is most notable in Meru, where the five big moons are treated the same as other inhabited planets.
!
! These categories are:
! + **Asteroid** - Uninhabitable long-term, no atmosphere. Major structures cannot be built, nor colonies created. Used primarily for resource extraction.
! + **Moon** - Small moons of inner-belt planets. No atmosphere, but enough gravity for population in sealed structures. Major structures can be built. Can be owned by individuals.
! + **Planet** - Solid inner planets and large moons, with atmosphere and gravity, maybe water and ecosphere as well. Major structures can be build, are subdivided into provinces. Can have orbitals, can't be owned by individuals (but can be [Governed](/orgs/roles)).
! + **Gas giants** - Large and gaseous, can't be landed on or built on, but can have orbitals. Can't be controlled or owned. This category also applies to the sun!
