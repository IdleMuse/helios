# Culture in the Helios System

Culture in the Helios system varies depending on the planet - some planets haven't really progressed past the colonial stage, with most settlements being small communities living off what they can grow in poor soil, whereas some planets, with better atmospheres, have big cities and the potential for an extremely comfortable living.

The traditional colonial spirit is one of self-determination; though no-one knows for sure, stories are told of the original Travellers actually building the arkships themselves to travel to the stars, part of great nation of explorers and adventurers. Many on these wilder planets will reject attempts to bring them together under central control, even with the faciltiies and opportunities it brings.

On the richer planets, opulence is in fashion. The richer you are, the more comfortable you can afford to be, and the more you can show that off the better. This doesn't necessarily always translate to Board executives of the major orgs, though (the players), as those that tend to gain power in orgs tend to be the more self-driven type!

Another culture altogether exists among the hardy independant space captains of the system. Despite owning (or operating) a ship, non-org captains tend to be two credits away from rock bottom, but nonetheless usually perfectly happy to sit in a crumbling fule station and recount tales of their adventures. Even if org products, org advertisements, and org taxes dominate the lives of surface-dwellers, these captains often have more actual contact with the orgs just by nature of operating in the same sphere.

A side note: the Vahana. While many Vahana live with the Vahana org, and on Vahana-controlled planets, they are seen commonly throughout the rest of the system as well, if maybe not a daily sighting, at least something that doesn't surprise anyone. While there is anti-vahana sentiment around, it is usually relating to their org status (much like there is sentiment agaisnt every big org when it comes to their dominance and lack of oversight) - The Easter Wars put paid to most anti-Vahana prejudice relating to their nonhumanity, and such views, while not unheard of, are likely to be seen as extremist or old-fashioned. This is particularly true on Vahana planets, where humans (which still make up the majority of the population even on these worlds) are well-treated as equals with their vahana masters - in fact Vahana planets tend to be fairly communist in nature.

#### The Maze

The Maze is the analogue of the real-world internet, but less well-organised, and less easy to use! Bits of it are frequently inaccessible for hours at a time, and most corners of it are rudimentary at best, serving mostly adverts, and bits and bobs of news. It's much better as transporting messages about (as this was its original purpose) and you can pretty freely get a message all the way across the system to/from some pretty remote receiving stations within a Cycle, depending on how often a ship comes by to carry the virtual package of mail.

As may be obvious, it doesn't handle real-time communication very well, not least because of the vast distances involved in even a planet to planet live link.
