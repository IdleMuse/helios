# Materials

Materials in Helios refers specifically to quanities of 'stuff' that is actually useful to build things in the system. Many other materials are used beyond those 'tracked' by the game, but they are in small enough quantities that they are just assumed to be cheap and plentiful enough that tracking tiny quantities of them is unnecessary.

#### Core materials used for constructions

+ **Iron**: While iron ore is pretty commonplace, good quality pure nodes of the type of ore needed for spaceship-level constructions take a little bit of finding. Still not too rare, though. Mined as ore that needs refining before use.
+ **Copper**: Vast quantities of copper are needed for the complex systems needed for lots of spaceship parts. Mined as ore that needs refining before use.
+ **Titanium**: Strong, light, but only recently developed into a form suitable for ship manufacture. Mined as ore that needs refining before use.
+ **Composites**: Unlike other materials here, composites are produced in factories rather than mined up out of the ground. They represent advanced materials (like carbon nanotubes) which is nonetheless made out of commonplace materials (like carbon). The exact composition of composite materials may vary, but they all serve the same purpose.

#### Auxiliary materials used for constructions

+ **Silver**: Commonly found int he asteroid belt, but rarely elsewhere, silver has some important uses in ship parts. Mined in raw form that needs no refining.
+ **Gold**: As rare as it is beautiful, gold isn't really used as a currency, but lots of ship parts (particularly electronics) need a bit (or a lot) of Gold. Mined in a raw form that needs no refining, however, the yield can be improved if refined.
+ **Vanadium**: Used in a couple of obscure ship parts. Mined in a crystal form that needs no refining.
+ **Diamonds**: Used in some weapons systems, pure natural diamonds of the calibre needed are extremely rare. Also often used as currency due to their enduring value. Mined as crystals that need no refining.

#### Materials used for power

+ **Helium-3**: Abundant throughout the system, Helium-3-bearing rock can be refined into pure He3 which is used as light ship fuel.
+ **Thorium**: Thorium is used in the big reactors that power structures on planet and lunar surfaces, and also on capital ships.

Materials are measured in kt - kilotonnes.

## Refineries

Materials that need to be refined can either be done so on any planet controlled by your org, or onboard a ship with a refinery module.

## Uses of Materials

Materials are used for a couple of key things:
+ Every Ship Hull has a cost in materials (commonly iron and titanium).
+ Ship Parts have costs in materials.
+ Ship Armour has a materials cost that is multplied based on the ship's size.
+ Many surface structures have costs in materials as well as money.
+ Orbitals have a cost in materials.
+ Drones and Mechs have a cost in materials.
+ Materials can be sold (and bought) on the Floor.
