# Helios - The Game

Helios is a hybrid Grand Strategy/RPG, where players take on the role of important members of the ruling councils of five major factions (called [Orgs](/orgs)) in order to steer their direction and expand their influence. The setting is the Helios System, a vast solar system to which humankind (and their then-servants, the AI Vahana) migrated around eighty cycles ago. The Helios system is dominated by the 'Belt', a dense asteroid belt which peters out into many small dwarf planets further out. Beyond this lie three gas giants, some with habitable moons, and then beyond that, an extensive field of exoplanets of varying sizes. More information on [History](/history) and the [Helios System](/planets).

### What's possible?

Though this is by no way an exhaustive lists, here's some of the things you might expect to do in Helios:

_Asteroid mining_ | _Ship design_ | _Researching technology_ | _Constructing capital ships_ | _Fighting pirates_ | _Exploring new planets and moons_ | _Colonising and terraforming_ 
::|::|::|::|::|::|::
_Building a personal fortune_ | _Spreading new ideas and religion_ | _Trading materials_ | _Espionage_ | _Sabotage_ | _Building megaprojects_ | _Diplomacy (both with NPCs and other player factions)_

### Playing the game

Each session will comprise of the players, as prominent members of each org, making decisions that shape the direction and activities of that org. For convenience, all five orgs will meet at the same time, though they will not interact in a normal session. Due to the nature of the [Vahana](/orgs/vahana), they will meet online, but the four other orgs will meet to face-to-face (though with the possibility of remote arrangements being made if necessary from time to time).

A session will begin with reports from the previous period, results of actions or orders issued, and opportunities and dispatches that have arisen in the meantime. The org will then discuss actions to be taken, and by the end of the session, individuals with responsibility for certain spheres of activity will write up orders, which will be sealed and signed to be processed before the next session. More information on the [system](/system) and [rules](/rules).

My current plan is to run this on **Alternating Friday Evenings**, throughout university term and holidays.
