# Religion in the Helios System

There is one major religion in the Helios system, known as the **Faith**, or the **Faith in Ra**. It is a monastic, sprititual faith based around self-discovery and meditation, and temples to it can be found in many places around the system, but the largest and most famous are in the Meru moons, where the faith is traditionally strong.

The core belief of the Faith is in the entity Ra, who lives in (or maybe _is_) the Helios sun, and through meditation on Ra, inner peace and fulfilment can be achieved and your spriritual destiny accomplished. Veneration of this sacred idea, this perfection insolated, bright and burning, an eternal beacon, captivates many, particularly those on the lower end of society. It isn't particularly common for an org board member to be strong in the faith, especially given that monks of the faith often make vows of poverty, but it's far from unheard of.

Adherents of the faith do not tend to _preach_ their religion, and instead spread the ideas through teaching. Temples, while often large, are not usually ostentatiously-decorated, and monasteries are usually in remote locations.

! The mechanical impact of Faith in Helios is represented by the **Faith Share**, a percentage indicator of how strong the Faith is in each orgs territory compared to the other factions' (and neutral) space.
!
! At game start, the Faith share is as follows: 
! 
! **Helios Heavy Industries** | 22%
! -::|::-
! **Neutral** | 18%
! **Fenris Systems** | 15%
! **Colonial Navy** | 15%
! **Miner's Guild** | 15%
! **Vahana** | 15%

!!!! Many concepts of the Faith are inspired by (or lifted wholesale from...) Hinduism. While you shouldn't take it for granted that all concepts translate across (there are not, for instance, multiple _deva_, nor is there the concept of reincarnation), you can't go too far wrong by looking at hindu monks for inspiration.

#### The Vahana

The Vahana Hive has not, as yet, formed a conclusion about the Faith. While vanana adherents are generally rare, among those few are some of the most respected teachers of the faith.

#### Other Religions

Other religions are rare, and are usually local cults or animistic traditions on some of the worlds where contact with civilisation is rare.
