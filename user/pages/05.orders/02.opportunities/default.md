# Opportunities

As well as the results of [orders](/orders), [feasibility reports](/orders/feasibility-reports), and dispatches, at the beginning of each session, various opportunities may be presented to the org council. These represent ideas or requests from people lower-down in your org, or even things happening outside your org, that you could capitalise on for additional benefit. Some of them may allow you to take additional actions, or require a reply, or may simply outline different outcomes for actions you could take normally anyway.

Example:

! It has been brought to your attention that the famous pirate Captain Mitchell is selling his fastest Reaver ship _The Jolly Rodger_ in an open auction on the Maze. We predict that at least 500kT of diamond will be required to make a competitive bid.
