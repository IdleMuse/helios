# Orders

The primary way players have of interacting with the world in Helios is by issuing **orders** at the regular game sessions. Game sessions happen at the beginning of each 'cycle' of play (see [Time](/time) for more information on what cycles actually represent), and over the course of that following cycle, your org carries out those orders, time progresses, and the success of those orders is reported back at the next session.

!!!! While there is a fixed set of predetermined 'orders' that can be issued, there is scope in each of them for flexibility; as much as this is inspired by video games, it isn't one, and the employees of your org are capable of understanding complex orders, with caveats, 'free text', or conditions.

Orders are always issued by an individual player. Even if they are generally-agreed-upon by the whole council, they are always signed off by one specific player, and that player is not required (by the rules, at least), to show the order paper to the council when submitting it, though obviously they can do. See [Roles](/orgs/roles) for more information.

!!!! This is obviously designed to enable intra-org intrigue and politics; while there are no rules about what consequences can be brought against players for working putting their own agendas before the org, I want it to nonetheless be possible. As part of this, if players wish to submit orders 'secretly' (or change orders they have submitted 'in council'), there will be a system for doing do in a short period after each session (by email).

Orders are classified into broad categories:

##### Fleet orders
+ Move Fleet
+ Change Standing Orders
+ Scuttle Fleet
+ Engage with target
+ Patrol
+ Bomb surface

##### [Science](/science) orders
+ Research discipline
+ Develop technology
+ Specialise lab
+ Terraform surface

##### Construction orders
+ Build surface structure
+ Build ships
+ Build orbital
+ Build surface detachment

##### [Trade](/economy/materials) and [Economy](/planets/population) orders
+ Sell at Auction
+ Bid on Auction
+ Sell locally
+ Change taxes

##### Diplomacy orders
+ Issue declaration
+ Extend offer

##### [Cargo](/economy/materials) orders
+ Transfer goods
+ Embark detachment or squadron
+ Land detachment/release squadron
+ Colonise planet or moon
+ Mine and process minerals

##### Espionage orders
+ Infiltrate faction command
+ Infiltrate research labs
+ Infiltrate fleet
+ Infiltrate populace
+ Train agent
+ Counter-espionage

##### Surface military orders
+ Suppress population
+ Capture territory
+ Destroy infrastructure

##### Exploration orders
+ Scan asteroid field
+ Scan planet
+ Explore territory

##### Miscellaneous orders
+ Commission [Feasibility Report](/orders/feasibility-reports)
+ Adopt Policy

Each specific order may encompass numerous different possibilities (see each one for details)

! Example of the flexibility of orders: Let's say you wanted to store 1000kt of Boron in a freighter in empty space between two planets, for some reason, but the Boron wasn't all due to arrive until some way through the cycle. Issuing a **Transfer Goods** order but adding on it "Wait until Boron has arrived from X" and "Halt and remain at point Y" would accomplish that, despite it not being a strictly normal 'goods transfer'.

! As is stated above, org employees are intelligent NPCs and will endeavour to carry out orders to the best of their abilities.
