# Ships

Spaceships are a pretty important part of Helios. While the average person in the system doesn't own one, they will certainly have seen one, whether they are an everyday part of their life or just a yearly supply-visit to their settlement. Most ships are owned and operated by the major [orgs](/orgs), though a fair few are privately owned, or operated by local, smaller orgs like planetary governments.

Ships are used for transport, exploration, mining, tourism, exploration, and so much more. Ship captains often live on their ships, rarely leaving them except for stopovers at moons or orbitals. Ships owned by orgs vary from the small cutters used to transport personnel around, through to enormous lumbering capitals ships with crew of hundreds.

### Size

Ships in Helios come in five 'size classes':

+ **Cutter** - Cutter-sized vessels are the smallest of ships, covering scouts, small freighters or dogfighters, usually requiring only a single pilot. The smallest of cutters (shuttles) aren't tracked by the system.
+ **Yacht** - Yacht-sized vessels are prolific, covering a huge variety of smaller types of ship, from fighters to tankers, miners to freighters. Yachts generally required 2-5 crew, though may carry more.
+ **Corvette** - Corvettes have become increasingly popular in the last twenty years, being a very useful size of ship larger than a small yacht, but not really a true capital ship with the manpower and materials that requires. Corvettes are incredibly flexible, and are often customised to meet individual crew needs.
+ **Sloop** - Sloops are smaller than true capital ships, though they mount the same systems and require a similarly large number of crew to operate. The only type of sloop commonly-operated is the Frigate, a fast military vessel.
+ **Galleon** - Galleons are the largest and grandest of the size classes. To date only used for military purposes, they include true battleships with heavy armour and long-range weapons, to the more modern carrier, with docking bays for smaller vessels.

The term **Capital Ship** is used to refer to all ships of the Sloop class and above. They are built with different ship parts, sized for captial ships.

### Ship hulls and Patterns

Every ship is comprised of a **ship hull** upon which **ship parts** are placed. Ship hulls are like templates - they define how many 'slots' you have available to fill inside the ship. Each org begins with a variety of ship hulls already known, and more can be researched. Ship parts comes in various types, and in two sizes - regular, for most normal ships, and larger-sized, for capital ships and sloops. On the ship hull templates, regular ships parts are square, and capital ship parts are hexagonal.

A specific layout of ship parts on a specific hull is known as a **pattern**. Ship patterns are used to simplify fleet management. All ships owned by an org _must_ conform to a ship pattern, though there is no limit to the number of ship patterns an org can create. When you want to upgrade components on a ship (for example, because you've researched newer technologies), you can upgrade the entire fleet that is using that pattern at once.

!!! _Example:_
!!!
!!! An org has designed a new ship pattern for a type of bomber. They picked the **Longship** hull, a multi-purpose corvette-class hull, and select ship parts to fill all the slots - an engine for the engine slot, a basic defensive weapon in the weapon slot, and a shield in the instrument slot. The rest of the slots, general purpose in nature, are filled with the bomb arrays. No armour is chosen, the ship will rely on its shields for defense. It is named the _Hades-class Bomber_/.
!!!
!!! The org goes ahead and builds a fleet of five Hades-class bombers. A year or so later, better bomb technology is available, as well as better engines, so the org decides to upgrade its Hades fleet. It pays a flat amount for the upgrade to the pattern, and a cycle later all the Hades-class bombers have changed over to the new technology.

Player-owned ships do not abide by the ship patterns of their org - treat each player as an independent org in this respect. Normally, they means that each ship owned by a player is unique, though there may be situations (such as with the [starting Squadron enterprise](/character-creation/enterprises/squadron)) where a player owns multiple ships of the same pattern.

##### Mechs and Drones

Mechs and Drones also use the Patterns system, mounting regular ships parts, albeit with a cost reduction to represent their scaled-down nature.

### Building a Ship

Ships are built in specialised orbitals called **Spacedocks**. Spacedocks have a certain capacity; they can only build a certain size of ship. For ships corvette-sized and below, once given a [Build Ships](/orders/build-ships/) order, a spacedock can complete the work in one cycle. For sloop-class vessels, two cycles are required. For Capital ships, three or more.

Spacedock capacity is based on its size, of which there are three possibilities: Regular, Large, and Huge.

! **Capacity of Spacedocks**
!
! **Regular**: 3 Cutter | 2 Yacht | 1 Corvette  
! **Large**: 6 Cutter | 4 Yacht | 2 Corvette | 1 Sloop  
! **Huge**: 9 Cutter | 6 Yacht | 3 Corvetter | 1 Sloop | 1 Galleon

##### [Materials](/economy/materials)

In order to complete a construction, a spacedock needs to have received the required resources by the end of the cycle. If they aren't delivered on time, completion is delayed until the end of the _next_ cycle.

The materials cost of a ship is calculated by adding up the materials costs of the relevant ship parts, the hull, and any armour needed. Some ship parts (including armour) have their cost multiplied based on the size of the ship.

! Size multipliers for armour
!
! **Cutter**: x0.5  
! **Yacht**: x1  
! **Corvette**: x4  
! **Sloop**: x100  
! **Galleon**: x200  

### Ship Combat

Ship combat is a complicated process, but takes place entirely in downtime following orders that would bring ships into conflict. While players may be piloting vessels involved, their actions are abstracted through the standing orders/tactics system.

Every weapon has a range. When a target ship is in range of that weapon, it can be fired, and has a chance to hit. Targeting computers can improve this chance, and maneuvering jets can reduce it. If it hits, then, depending on the type of weapon, it might damage shields or armour. If a ship has no shields or armour remaining, then it may damage the ship hull and/or systems. Once the hull has taken a certain amount of damage, the ship is destroyed, leaving behind a wreck, which could be recovered later.

### Fuel, and travel

All ships require fuel to move long distances. Anything smaller than a planet-to-planet hop isn't tracked. Large ships, like Capital Ships, need different fuel to smaller ships, due to their huge power requirements (and thus different types of reactors). Fuel for smaller ships is widely available.

Information about how much fuel is needed to make specific journeys will be available.
