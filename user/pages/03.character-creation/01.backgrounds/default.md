# Character Backgrounds

Every player starts with a background chosen from this page. Some backgrounds give you additional options, or increase the effectiveness of actions that you perform. While there are many people in the Helios system who don't work in these spheres, these represent the likely backgrounds of people who went on to have the prominence that player characters do.

All backgrounds also slightly increase your org's effectiveness at certain actions. This is normalised based on the number of players in your org, so having more players isn't necessarily an advantage.

All backgrounds may have additional effects not listed here.

## Science

Having a background in science means you have likely worked your way up through the academic routes in your org; perhaps you were part of a lab team behind a recent scientific breakthrough, or a respected theoretician responsible for groundbreaking new ideas.

! **A Science background increases the effectiveness of all Science Labs you own by X%, increases the effectiveness of all Research Orders you issue by X%, and improves all Science actions performed by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

If you choose a science background, you may also pick a specialisation from the following list of [Disciplines](/science):

- Materials
- Energetics
- Weapons
- Engineering
- Biotechnology
- AI

! **A discipline specialisation allows you to turn regular science labs into specialised labs. Specialised labs are more effective at researching that specific discipline, but cannot perform other research.**

## Politics

Rising to prominence in your org from a political background usually means you had some prominence in an important planet owned by your org, or in an important conflict for your org. All politics backgrounds are either Civil (you rose up through local planetary government), or Religious (you rose through one of the religious orders).

! **A Politics background lowers the revolt risk on moons you own by X%, increases the effectiveness of all Diplomatic Orders you issue by X%, and improves all Political actions performed by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

! **Additionally, a Civil Politics background increases your personal status by X, while a Religious Politics background increases or decreases your personal status based on the [faith share](/religion) of your org.**

!! The Personal Status system has been removed, as have 'political actions', so this section needs reworking

## Military

Each org has its own military forces, as do, to some extend, all planets. A military background means you worked your way to power through this military structure, either through terrestial forces on planets and moons, or naval forces, commanding large military vessels.

! **A Naval Military background increases the effectiveness of military ships of at least Corvette size of which you are in direct command by X%, and improves all Naval actions performed by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

! **A Terrestrial Military background increases the effectiveness of terrestrial detachments you are in direct command of by X%, increases the effectiveness of all Terrestial Military orders you issue by X%, and improves all Terrestrial Military actions performed by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

Alternatively, your military background may be somewhat less well-known. Corporate and Military espionage is a a big deal when one stolen secret can make the difference between gaining a planet and losing a fleet.

! **An Espionage background increases the effectiveness of Espionage Orders you issue by X%, increases the effectiveness of Espionage actions you perform by X%, and improves your org's resistance to espionage proportional to the number of players in it.**

## Finance

Most orgs are, after all, corporations, and even those that aren't have significant financial dealings to manipulate to their advantage. Whether it's trading materials on the free market, currency exchange, adjusting taxes, or negotiating the purchase and absorbtion of minor orgs, people with financial background are needed for many of the day-to-day operations of a major org.

! **A Financial background increases your personal profit from moons you own and Trade actions you perform by X%, increases the value of Trade Orders you issue by X%, and increases your org's tax income proportional to the number of players in it.**

## Independent Operations

The final class of backgrounds is Independant Operations. This means that you were an independant ship captain, maybe loosely associated with one of the orgs, but not in any major way. How you came to be in power in the major org is a question that I leave up to your imagination to define, but some examples are: becoming powerful enough to be 'bought' by an org, finding something out and blackmailing your way to power, or simply being talented enough to enter the org high up and shoot to the top.

_Independent Operations backgrounds are not available to the Vahana._

! **An Independent Ops background allows you to personally commission an additional Feasbility Report.**

If you choose an Independent Ops background, you may also pick a specialisation from the following list:

##### Mining

As an independent captain, you had most experience at mining asteroids for minerals, and selling them either to the Guild or directly on to freighter captains, brokers, or planetary orgs.

! **A Mining specialisation increases the effectiveness of any mining performed by ships you own by X%, and increases the effectiveness of any mining performed by ships owned by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Freighter

As an independent captain, you earnt most of your living ferrying cargo (or people) back and forth... legally or otherwise.

! **A Freighter specialisation increases the fuel efficiency of any ships you own by X%, and increases the fuel efficiency of any ships owned by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Mercenary

Before joining an org, you were a mercenary captain, either flying solo, or part of a mercenary wing, selling your services to the highest bidder.

! **A Mercenary specialisation increases the combat effectiveness of any ships you fly of at most Freighter size by X%, and decreases the cost to your org of hiring mercenaries proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Salvage

As an independent captain, you spent most of your time picking over the edges of naval battles, or scouring asteroid fields, for the remains of crashed or destroyed vessels, and harvesting them for whatever you could. Maybe, from time to time, you also weren't averse to _making_ some salvage if the going got tough...

! **A Salvage specialisation grants you an income from any Stardocks or Wrecking yards you own depending on their capacity, and decreases the cost to your org of building vessels of at most Freighter size proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Pirate

Before joining an org, you were a pirate. Either working alone, in a small group, or in a larger comglomerate of pirates, you ambushed and boarded merchant freighters and either stole the ships wholesale, or made off with as much cargo as you could carry. At times, this meant clashing with the authorities, but the asteroid fields were always large enough for you to hide away before being caught.

! **A Pirate specialisation increases the effectiveness of Diplomatic Orders you issue relating to pirates by X%, and increases the combat effectiveness of your org against pirates proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Explorer

Though much of the surveying and scanning of the Helios system is carried out by the orgs, there is still some money to be made in independent captains prospecting through the asteroid belt, or exploring the moons of the furthest exoplanets. Discovering a hidden secret, a clue to the history of the Helios system, or a rich seam of rare minerals, could easily catapult such a scout to prominence in an org.

! **An Explorer specialisation allows you to personally take Exploration actions, and increases the effectiveness of Exploration Orders issued by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**
