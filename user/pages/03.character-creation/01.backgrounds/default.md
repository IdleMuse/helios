!! This section includes lots of 'X%' placeholders - these will be filled in before the game begins!

# Character Backgrounds

Every player starts with a background chosen from this page. Some backgrounds give you additional options, or increase the effectiveness of actions that you perform. While there are many people in the Helios system who don't work in these spheres, these represent the likely backgrounds of people who went on to have the prominence that player characters do.

All backgrounds also slightly increase your org's effectiveness at certain actions. This is normalised based on the number of players in your org, so having more players isn't necessarily an advantage.

All backgrounds may have additional effects not listed here.

## Science

Having a background in science means you have likely worked your way up through the academic routes in your org; perhaps you were part of a lab team behind a recent scientific breakthrough, or a respected theoretician responsible for groundbreaking new ideas.

! **A Science background increases the effectiveness of all Science Labs you own by 25%, improves all [Research Orders](/orders/research-discipline) you issue by 10%, and speeds up all [Development](/orders/develop-technology) performed by your org by a maximum of 20%, reduced proportional to the number of players in it.**

If you choose a science background, you may also pick a specialisation from the following list of [Disciplines](/science):

- Materials
- Energetics
- Weapons
- Engineering
- Biotechnology
- AI

! **A discipline specialisation allows you to turn regular science labs into [specialised labs](/orders/specialise-lab). Specialised labs are 50% more effective, but are limited to research and development in one discipline.**

## Politics

Rising to prominence in your org from a political background usually means you had some prominence in an important planet owned by your org, or in an important conflict for your org. All politics backgrounds are either **Civil** (you rose up through local planetary government), or **Religious** (you rose through one of the religious orders).

! **A Politics background lowers the base revolt risk on moons you own to 3%, improves all Diplomatic Orders you issue by 30%, and improves the base opinion of your org by a maximum of 100%, reduced proportional to the number of players in it.**

! **Additionally, a Civil Politics background provides special actions that can be taken on any provinces you govern, while a Religious Politics background increases the [faith share](/religion) of your org by 5%.**

## Military

Each org has its own military forces, as do, to some extend, many planets. A military background means you worked your way to power through this military structure, either commanding mechs and drones on planetary/lunar surfaces, or serving in naval forces, commanding large military vessels.

! **A Naval Military background increases the effectiveness of large military ships (at least Corvette size) of which you are in direct command by X%, and improves all Naval actions performed by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

! **A Terrestrial Military background increases the effectiveness of terrestrial detachments you are in direct command of by X%, increases the effectiveness of all Terrestial Military orders you issue by X%, and improves all Terrestrial Military actions performed by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

Alternatively, your military background may be somewhat less well-known. Corporate and Military espionage is a a big deal when one stolen secret can make the difference between gaining a planet and losing a fleet.

! **An Espionage background increases the effectiveness of Espionage Orders you issue by X%, increases the effectiveness of Espionage actions you perform by X%, and improves your org's resistance to espionage proportional to the number of players in it.**

## Finance

Most orgs are, after all, corporations, and even those that aren't have significant financial dealings to manipulate to their advantage. Whether it's trading materials on the free market, currency exchange, adjusting taxes, or negotiating the purchase and absorbtion of minor orgs, people with financial background are needed for many of the day-to-day operations of a major org.

! **A Financial background increases the direct income you gain from Enterprises you own by 10%, increases the value of Sell orders you issue by 5%, and increases your org's tax income by a maximum of 10%, reduced proportional to the number of players in it.**

## Independent Operations

The final class of backgrounds is Independent Operations. This means that befrore joining an org, you were an independent ship captain, either piloting your own vessel, or working as an agent for others. How you came to be in power in the major org is a question that I leave up to your imagination to define, but some examples are: becoming powerful enough to be 'bought' by an org, discovering some secret and blackmailing your way to power, or simply being talented enough to enter the org high up and shoot to the top.

_Independent Operations backgrounds are not available to the Vahana._

! **An Independent Ops background allows you to personally commission an additional Feasbility Report.**

If you choose an Independent Ops background, you may also pick a specialisation from the following list:

##### Mining

As an independent captain, you had most experience at mining asteroids for minerals, and selling them either to the Guild or directly on to freighter captains, brokers, or planetary orgs.

! **A Mining specialisation increases the yield of any mining performed by ships you own by 5%, and by ships owned by your org proportional by a maximum of 10%, reduced proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Freighter

As an independent captain, you earnt most of your living ferrying cargo (or people) back and forth... legally or otherwise.

! **A Freighter specialisation increases the fuel efficiency of any ships you own by X%, and increases the fuel efficiency of any ships owned by your org proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Mercenary

Before joining an org, you were a mercenary captain, either flying solo, or part of a mercenary wing, selling your services to the highest bidder.

! **A Mercenary specialisation increases the combat effectiveness of any ships you fly (of yacht-class and below) by X%, and decreases the cost to your org of hiring mercenaries by a maximum of 50%, reduced proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Salvage

As an independent captain, you spent most of your time picking over the edges of naval battles, or scouring asteroid fields, for the remains of crashed or destroyed vessels, and harvesting them for whatever you could. Maybe, from time to time, you also weren't averse to _making_ some salvage if the going got tough...

! **A Salvage specialisation grants you an income from any Spacedocks or Wrecking yards you own depending on their capacity, and decreases the material cost to your org of building yacht-class and smaller vessels by a maximum of 5%, reduced proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Pirate

Before joining an org, you were a pirate. Either working alone, in a small group, or in a larger organised band of pirates, you ambushed and boarded merchant freighters and either stole the ships wholesale, or made off with as much cargo as you could carry. At times, this meant clashing with the org authorities, but the asteroid fields were always large enough for you to hide away before being caught.

! **A Pirate specialisation improves all Diplomatic Orders you issue relating to pirates by 70%, and increases the combat effectiveness of your org against pirates proportional to the number of players in it.**

##### Explorer

Though much of the surveying and scanning of the Helios system is carried out by the orgs, there is still some money to be made in independent captains prospecting through the asteroid belt, or exploring the moons of the furthest exoplanets. Discovering a hidden secret, a clue to the history of the Helios system, or a rich seam of rare minerals, could easily catapult such a scout to prominence in an org.

! **An Explorer specialisation allows you to personally take Exploration actions, and improves Exploration Orders issued by your org by a maximum of 100%, reduced proportional to the number of players in it.**
