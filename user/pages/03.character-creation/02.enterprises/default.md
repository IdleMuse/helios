# Starting Enterprises

Every player starts with an enterprise chosen from this page, and may obtain more through play. Each enterprise gives you either various additional abilities, income, or prestige.

### Ship

Owning a ship means that if you wish to travel somewhere personally between sessions, you don't need to rely on your org having one available for you to travel on. Additionally, you can upgrade and customise it without having to stick to a [Ship Pattern](/ships). A ship bought as your starting enterprise (or built later) can only be up to Corvette size, nothing larger, but that does covers such ships as shuttles, scouts, freighters, fighters, small miners, and so forth.

See [Starting Ship Templates](/character-creation/enterprises/ship) for a list of ship designs you can choose as your starting enterprise.

### Moon

The Moon enterprise represents a moon that you either rule or own outright. You can draw tax from your lunar citizens, though due to the size of moons, they can't be terraformed, and so are limited in population. Your moon also starts with a solar power station, and one structure on it, chosen from the following list:

+ Mine ([Tier 1 materials](/economy/materials))
+ Factory (Composites, Drones, or Mechs)
+ Lunar shield
+ Leisure complex
+ Temple

! A starting enterprise moon has a population of X, producing a base tax income of **500cr/cycle**.
! For more information on the options given, see [Structures](/science/technology/structures)

### Orbital station

Unlike moons, orbital stations don't generate tax income; they are smaller, and more specialised. They also come in various types, from which you must pick one:

+ **Spacedock** - Spacedocks are highly specialised orbital stations designed solely for the construction (and repair) of ships. Each Spacedock has a limit on the total displacement of ships it can be building at any one time; starting Enterprise spacedocks are large enough to build [Corvettes](/ships) but nothing larger.
+ **Research lab** - All research is done in orbital labs. For more information, see [Research](/science).
+ **Wrecking yard** - A wrecking yard is a station equipped to strip down ships and hulks for valuable materials, or to glean scientific intelligence from ships of other factions.
+ **Fuel station** - Fuel stations are smaller orbital facilities dotted around the system for smaller ships that use simple Helium-3 fuel. As well as large storage tanks, fuel stations also tend to have a lot of convenience facilities for ship captains passing through, and a lot of small-scale trading occurs on these important stop-offs. Unlike the other orbital stations, fuel stations provide an income to their owners, although this depends on how much traffic flows through it.

All orbital stations have patterns much like ships (although as with player-owned ships, player-owned stations can be customised independently). See [Starting Orbital Templates](/character-creation/enterprises/orbital-station) for a list of patterns you can choose as your starting enterprise.

! See [Orbital stations](/science/technology/orbitals) for details on how orbital stations function.

### Asteroid claim

While the orgs ensure that the space around their territory is policed to a degree, the [asteroid belt](/planets) is a largely ungoverned frontier. There exists, however, a tacit agreement between miners in the belt to honor each others mining claims, staked with a simple claim marker beacon. These are backed up by registration with the [Miner's Guild](/orgs/miners-guild), who will refuse to deal with claim-jumpers and will (in theory) actively pursue repeat offenders.

Mining claims can be staked by anyone, but registration with the guild has a cost associated with it, so a certain amount of prospecting occurs prior to staking claims (to avoid staking an extensive claim on worthless rubble). Characters starting with an asteroid claim enterprise can choose one of two types:

+ **Prospected** - A prospected claim may be one you have scanned yourself, or simply bought, but either way you know exactly what minerals it contains. The options are:
  + (list of Tier 1-2 minerals)
+ **Unprospected** - An unprospected claim is one that will likely contain some valuable materials, but which, you do not know. (Tier 2-4 minerals).

!!!! The contents of unprospected claims are randomly determined when they are scanned, from a secret table.

### Fighter Squadron

Owning your own ship is fair enough, but how about a whole squadron of fighters? Squadrons include 3-5 ships, and pilots to fly them. You have less flexibility in customising fighter squadrons than you do individual ships, however (they must all stick to a single [Ship Pattern](/ships)) and they cannot operate independently from one another.

See [Starting Squadron Templates](/character-creation/enterprises/squadron) for the list of squadrons you can pick as a starting enterprise.

### Surface Detachment

Where ships fight in space (and the upper atmosphere), controlling territory on planets requires terrestrial troops. Owning and commanding a surface detachment allows you to control and explore territory on behalf of your org. Surface detachments come in two types:

+ **Mech** - Typically heavily-armed and armoured, mechs are extra good at taking and holding provinces.
+ **Drone** - Usually light and aerial, drones are faster than mechs, and better for exploring.

Mechs and drones have Patterns much like ships and orbitals. See [Starting Detachment Templates](/character-creation/enterprises/surface) for the list of detachments you can pick as a starting enterprise.

### Status Symbol

Status symbols cover lots of other personal enterprises you might own. Structures like extravagant zoos, prisons, great temples, manufacturies for luxury goods, agricultural complexes, opera houses. For the most part they all act exactly the same, providing you with additional income.

! A Status Symbol enterprise increases your base income by **1000cr/cycle**.

Exceptions do exist:

! A religious status symbol instead increases your org's [faith share](/religion) by 5%.

!!!! Players are welcome to discuss with me other ideas they have for status symbols, and those may have different mechanical effects.

## Locating your Enterprise

When creating your character, you need to specify, for all enterprises, a location. For static enterprises like moons and orbital stations, this is obviously just where they are.

+ **Ship** - The location you choose is simply where the ship begins when you start play.
+ **Moon** - For Moon enterprises, you must choose a planet for your moon to be in orbit of (though it doesn't need to be controlled by your org!), either a [main belt planet](/planets) or [Meru](/planets/meru).
+ **Orbital station** - Orbital stations, like moons, need to be located around a planet, although unlike moons they must be in orbit of a planet (or large moon) in your org to operate (with the exception of fuel stations).
+ **Asteroid claim** - While the precise location of each asteroid claim is on record with the Miner's guild, mechanically all you need to specify is which [sector of the belt](/planets) it is in.
+ **Fighter squadron/surface detachment** - Like a ship, all the location for these enterprises indicates is where they begin when you start play. For detachments, you must specify a territory on a planet for them to start in.
+ **Status symbol** - Status symbols can only be located in your org, or in neutral territory; they cease to give you benefits if controlled by a rival org. They must either be in orbit, or in a territory on a planet.

No enterprise can be located in 'dead space'. At start of game, this includes anywhere inside the innermost asteroid, or outside the planets of Meru and Benu.
