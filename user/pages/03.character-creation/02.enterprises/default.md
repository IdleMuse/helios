# Starting Enterprises

Every player starts with an enterprise chosen from this page, and may obtain more through play. Each enterprise gives you either various additional abilities, income, or prestige.

### Ship

Owning a ship means that if you wish to travel somewhere personally between sessions, you don't need to rely on your org having one available for you to travel on. Additionally, you can upgrade and customise it without having to stick to a [Ship Pattern](/ships). A ship bought as your starting enterprise (or built later) can only be up to Corvette size, nothing larger, but that does covers such ships as shuttles, scouts, freighters, fighters, small miners, and so forth.

See [Starting Ship Templates](/character-creation/enterprises/ship) for details on what a ship chosen as your starting enterprise can be.

### Moon

The Moon enterprise represents a moon that you either govern or own outright. You can draw tax from your lunar citizens, though due to the size of moons, they can't be terraformed, and so are limited in population. Your moon also starts with a solar power station, and one building on it, chosen from the following list:

+ Mine (Tier 1 materials)
+ Factory (Composites or Drones)
+ Lunar shield
+ Leisure complex

See [Starting Moon Templates](character-creation/enterprises/moon) for more precise details on what a starting moon can have.

### Orbital station

Unlike moons, orbital stations don't generate tax income; they are smaller, and more specialised. They also come in various types, from which you must pick one:

+ **Spacedock** - Spacedocks are highly specialised orbital stations designed solely for the construction of ships and ship parts. Each Spacedock has a limit on the total displacement of ships it can be building at any one time; starting Enterprise spacedocks are large enough to build [Corvettes](/ships) but nothing larger.
+ **Research lab** - All research is done in orbital labs. For more information, see [Research](/science).
+ **Fuel station** - Fuel stations are smaller orbital facilities dotted around the system for smaller ships that use simple hydrogen fuel. As well as large storage tanks, fuel stations also tend to have a lot of convenience facilities for ship captains passing through, and a lot of small-scale trading occurs on these important stop-offs. Unlike the other orbital stations, fuel stations provide an income to their owners, although this depends on how much traffic flows through it.
+ **Wrecking yard** - A wrecking yard is a station equipped to strip down ships and hulks for valuable materials, or to glean scientific intelligence from ships of other factions.

All orbital stations have patterns much like ships (although as with player-owned ships, player-owned stations can be customised independently). See [Starting Orbital Station Templates](/character-creation/enterprises/orbital-station) for details.

### Asteroid claim

While the orgs ensure that the space around their territory is policed to a degree, the [asteroid belt](/planets) is a largely ungoverned frontier. There exists, however, a tacit agreement between miners in the belt to honor each others mining claims, staked with a simple claim marker beacon. These are backed up by registration with the [Miner's Guild](/orgs/miners-guild), who will refuse to deal with claim-jumpers and will active pursue repeat offenders.

Mining claims can be staked by anyone, but registration with the guild has a cost associated with it, so a certain amount of prospecting occurs prior to staking claims (to avoid staking an extensive claim on worthless rubble). Characters starting with an asteroid claim enterprise can choose one of two types:

+ **Prospected** - A prospected claim may be one you have scanned yourself, or simply bought, but either way you know exactly what minerals it contains. The options are:
  + (list of Tier 1-2 minerals)
+ **Unprospected** - An unprospected claim is one that will likely contain some valuable materials, but which, you do not know. It differs from a **Virgin claim** in that there is no chance of it just being worthless. (Tier 2-4 mineral).

!!!! The contents of unprospected claims are randomly determined when they are scanned, from a secret table.

### Fighter Squadron

Owning your own ship is fair enough, but how about a whole squadron of fighters! Squadrons include 3-5 ships of Fighter size and loadout, and pilots to fly them. You have less flexibility in customising fighter squadrons than you do individual ships, however (they must all stick to a single [Ship Pattern](/ships) and cannot operate independently from one another.

See [Starting Squadron Templates](/character-creation/enterprises/squadron) for details on how your squadron can be built.

### Surface Detachment

Where ships fight in space (and the upper atmosphere), controlling territory on planets requires terrestrial troops. Owning and commanding a surface detachment allows you control and explore territory on behalf of your org. Surface detachments come in two types:

+ **Mech** - For land territories only, extra good at taking and holding terrain.
+ **Drone** - For land and sea territories, faster than mechs, better for exploring.

### Status Symbol

Status symbols cover lots of other personal enterprises you might own. Things like extravagant zoos, prisons, temples, manufacturies for luxury goods, farming complexes, opera houses. For the most part they all act exactly the same, providing you with additional personal status.

! A Status Symbol enterprise increases your personal status by X

Exceptions do exist:

! A Temple status symbol instead increases your org's [faith share](/religion) by X

## Locating your Enterprise

All enterprises need to have a location. For static enterprises like moons and orbital stations, this is obviously just where they are.

+ **Ship** - The location you choose is simply where the ship begins when you start your character.
+ **Moon** - For Moon enterprises, you must choose a planet for your moon to be in orbit of. You cannot obtain tax from your moon unless the planet is under the control of an org (though it doesn't need to be yours!), and will pay tax in the local currency of that org.
+ **Orbital station** - Orbital Stations, like moons, need to be located around a planet, although unlike moons they must be in orbit of a planet in your org to operate, with the exception of fuel stations, which pay income in your org's currency.
+ **Asteroid claim** - While the exact location of each asteroid claim is on record with the Miner's guild, mechanically all you need to specify is which sector of the belt it is in.
+ **Fighter squadron** - Like a ship, all the location for a fighter squadron indicates is where the squadron begins when you start your character.
+ **Status symbol** - Status symbols can only be located in your org, or in neutral territory; they cease to give you benefits if controlled by a rival org. They must either be in orbit, or in a territory on a planet.

No enterprise can be located in [Unexplored Space](/map). At start of game, this includes anywhere inside the innermost asteroid, or outside the planets of Meru and Benu.
